                        <p><strong>About &ndash; Modern Energy Cooking Services(MECS), Programme</strong></p>
                        <p><br /></p>
                        <p>1.8 billion people have access to electricity but still, cook with biomass. Load shedding, weak grids,</p>
                        <p>affordability of electricity, accessibility of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), tradition, perceptions, energy</p>
                        <p>governance, and a lack of suitable cooking appliances all act as barriers to scaling up the use of</p>
                        <p>electricity or gas for cooking &ndash; clean cooking. The Modern Energy Cooking Services Programme is</p>
                        <p>funded by UKAid through the Department for International Development, led by Loughborough</p>
                        <p>University. We already know that increasing access through renewable energy generation is</p>
                        <p>becoming more affordable and opening new windows of opportunity. New business models and</p>
                        <p>smart monitoring are improving the reliability of LPG distribution, appliances can be made more</p>
                        <p>energy efficient but still cook favourite foods so they taste right, and cooking with electricity is</p>
                        <p>becoming increasingly affordable with issues of reliability and sustainability being overcome. We</p>
                        <p>want to build on these opportunities and the new knowledge emerging from the MECS programme</p>
                        <p>to break out of business-as-usual approaches and rapidly accelerate the transition from biomass to</p>
                        <p>clean cooking on a global scale.</p>

                        <p>Globally, MECS is now well established as a prominent programme in the clean cooking domain and</p>

                        <p>to emerge as a Global Hub for manufacturing clean cooking devices for domestic and international</p>
                        <p>markets, thus aligning with the Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India mission. In addition, it focuses</p>
                        <p>on becoming a major convening and facilitation programme to achieve the shift to modern energy</p>
                        <p>cooking within India, supporting the GoElectric campaign launched by the Government of India.</p>
                        <p>During the last two and half years, it has been instrumental in building critical connections among</p>
                        <p>key stakeholders and promoting modern energy-based clean cooking solutions. In India the</p>
                        <p>programme works on 4 strands i.e Innovation, Policy Support, Supply Chain &ndash; enabling clean cooking</p>
                        <p>device manufacturers, and consumers.</p>
